            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>News & Views(N&V) is our weekly institutional newsletter, highlighting programs, publications, and other events at MEI. Scott will add the main body content to the newsletter, usually on Friday mornings. The rest of the newsletter, namely the Sidebar and “Scholars in the News” section, is filled in by the interns and should be ready before noon on Fridays to allow time for Scott and Kate to review it before sending out around 2pm.</p>
            <p>You can see a sample issue of N&V <a href="http://myemail.constantcontact.com/A-Look-at-Egypt-s-Short-and-Long-Term-Challenges---News---Views-.html?soid=1102919617474&aid=fKvkN5LLs7E" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>Sidebar Sections</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>New Publications:</strong> Title, Author, and Link to articles published on MEI’s website since the last issue of N&V</li>
              <li><strong>Upcoming Events:</strong> Date, Time, Event Title, and Link to any upcoming events that have corresponding Event pages on the site.</li>
              <li><strong>MEJ Editor’s Blog:</strong> Linked Titles for three recent blog posts by our Middle East Journal editor, Michael Dunn.  We usually try to include two of his more research-heavy pieces, and one funny one.</li>
              <li><strong>MAP Highlights:</strong> Linked Titles to new publications on The Middle East-Asia Project page, if any new ones have been posted in the past week.</li>
              <li><strong>Middle East Journal:</strong> Linked Photo of the cover of the most recent MEJ. We only have to change this four times a year ;-)</li>
              <li><strong>Follow MEI and MEI Directory:</strong> shouldn’t have to touch these.</li>

            <h3>'Scholars in the News' Section</h3>
            <p>
              This is the original purpose of the News & Views newsletter--to draw attention to the weekly activities of our 40 Middle East scholars--and they do read this section closely to make sure their media hits were included, so be careful to add everything they send us!
            </p>
            <p>
              The challenge is how to make this section not totally boring.  Using the Media Tracking sheet, add sections for the relevant categories (usually the name of the country that is the primary subject of the media hits) and list the individual Scholar records.  If one scholar has spoken on multiple topics, choose whichever you think is best and go ahead and mention the other hits within the same paragraph.

            <h3>Example Scholars Section Entries</h3>
            <blockquote>
              <p style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;color:black;">Syria</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Randa Slim</strong> was quoted in the <a href="#"></a><em>New York Times</em></a> article, "Syrian Fighting Gives Hezbollah New but Diffuse Purpose."</li>
                  <li><strong>Paul Salem</strong> was interviewed by Nicholas Blanford of the Christian Science Monitor for the <a href="#">story</a>, "How the Ukraine crisis made Iran a better US partner on Syria." He was also interviewed by NPR's Deborah Amos for a forthcoming segment.</li>
                  <li><strong>Daniel Serwer</strong> appeared on the Al Hurra program "Final Edition," commenting on Iraq and Syria. He also discussed Bosnia with Al Jazeera America.</li>
                  <li><strong>Richard Murphy</strong> discussed events in Syria with Arise TV.</li>
                </ul>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              List media hits that have hyperlinks first, since they’re more engaging. Try to only list scholars once by combining less important hits with their more important ones, like in the third bullet with Daniel Serwer.
            </p>
            <p>
              A section for “Appearances” will go at the bottom (they’re the least exciting, and never have hyperlinks)
            </p>

            <h3>The Nudge E-mail</h3>
            <p>
              Every Tuesday, send an email to the scholars asking if they had any speaking appearances/interviews/articles published/etc. in the past week (or anything upcoming that they know of). Send the email to the list-serv:  mei-scholars@messenger.mideasti.org -- this will ensure that all of the scholars we include in News and Views get the reminder.
