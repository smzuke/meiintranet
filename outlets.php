				<h3>Politico Magazine</h3>
				<blockquote><p>We publish both original reporting and distinctive opinion journalism that illuminate the people, ideas, and institutions that matter most in American politics and government. We're much less interested in garden-variety op-eds, especially on narrow subjects or those with a limited shelf life.</p>
				<p>What works: Big swings at big subjects. Deep dives on the hidden forces shaping politics in a key state. Timely, original reporting on matters of national importance. Well-targeted book excerpts. Profiles of the major players influencing the political debate â€“ or the backstage players who soon will. Unique data or new findings that challenge the conventional wisdom. Smart, elevated media criticism.</p></blockquote>
